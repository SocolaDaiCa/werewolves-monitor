## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:

```
[OK] "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
[OK] "Good catch [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
[OK] [Just fix it and show in the code]

[NG] "You're absolutely right!"
[NG] "Great point!"
[NG] "Thanks for catching that!"
[NG] "Thanks for [anything]"
[NG] ANY gratitude expression
```


**why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

**If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

```
[OK] "You were right I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now.
[OK] "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

[NG] Long apology
[NG] Defending why you pushed back
[NG] Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.
