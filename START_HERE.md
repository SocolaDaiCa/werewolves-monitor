## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Start Implementation Immediately
Tell me which phase to implement:

> **"Let's start Phase 1: Setup & Structure"**

I will:
- ✅ Create all Vue components
- ✅ Set up Vuex stores
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Add translations
- ✅ Make it mobile-responsive
- ✅ Fix linting errors

Then show you the code!

### Option 2: Review Documentation First
Read the docs in this order (20-30 minutes total):

1. **PHASE_OVERVIEW.md** (5 min) - Visual breakdown of all 10 phases
2. **SPEC.md** (10 min) - What we're building
3. **CHECKLIST.md** (5 min) - How detailed the tasks are
4. **DESIGN_GUIDE.md** (5 min) - Design system we'll use
5. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** (5 min) - Communication protocol

Then tell me which phase to start!

### Option 3: Ask Questions First
Before implementing, you can ask:
- "Can I skip Phase 1?" → (No, Phase 1 is foundational)
- "How long is this really?" → (38-47 hours realistic)
- "Can we use Vue 3?" → (No, project uses Nuxt 2)
- "Do I need to know Vue?" → (Helpful but not required)
- "Can we do phases in parallel?" → (No, sequential only)
